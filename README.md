# Melapix

## Description
Melapix is your go-to online source for high-style, high resolution stock photo images featuring people of color. It is a celebration of the beauty and majesty of people who perhaps have not (often enough) seen themselves portrayed in such fashion.

Standard users of this application are able to search, view and save images to their collection for later usage.

Users with a seller (photographer) account are able to view, edit and delete thier images, as well as see data displaying their images that have been saved by other users.
